# Learning

Contains a collection of small tools/projects that I have completed as a part of a course or my own personal learnings. Contains a variant that runs on a schedule, and one that uses the watchdog library to monitor a directory for events.

## Python

Learning tasks/activities in python

### pi_given_rand

This project is a Python script that calculates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method. It generates random points within a square and counts how many fall within a quarter circle inscribed in the square. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points approximates pi/4.

### yaml_json_util

Created as a part of exploring the way JSON and YAML interact from an extremely simplistic perspective. Makes use of python libraries for all the heavy lifting.
